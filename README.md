#h1 Local Community Book Club
My Local Community Book Club site is aimed at people who love reading and also people who want to start reading more. It offers reading groups for readers of all abilities and children, so whatever level you are there is something for you. Being focused on local community, it aims to bring local people together and share their love of reading.
